				<p>Lucidity, or Jastnost in Chernarussian, is a psychoactive substance administered as an eye drop. Black in color, it leaves a slightly greasy feeling in the eyes. The drug heightens the senses and creates a dissociative state reducing fear and inhibition, particularly in regard to violence and pain. Effects vary from person to person: some simply enjoy the release from their worries, while others tend toward unrestrained cruelty. Users describe a feeling of being unclouded by emotion or anxiety. The primary effects typically last 6-12 hours, while secondary effects taper off over the course of 2-3 days. Occasional users enjoy the glow of the secondary effects, while addicts find the weakening of the drug's primary effects bothersome or intolerable. </p>
				
				<p>The drug is highly addictive, with many users becoming hooked after just one or two doses. Addicts typically experience a painful and emotional crippling withdrawal that often ends in suicide. Symptoms ramp up over the course of a few days once the secondary glow ends and are much more severe in heavier users. Physical symptoms include nausea, cold sweats, agonizing cramping, and sometimes seizures. Mental effects include overwhelming, erratic emotional reactions, paranoia, and increased anxiety about every-day decision making. Mental side-effects are very commonly worsened by guilt and regret surrounding decisions made while under the influence of the drug.</p>
				
				<p>Lucidity has a very limited shelf-life, after which the performance-heightening effects diminish and additional side-effects appear. These most often include erratic emotions, increased aggression, paranoia, hallucinations, and psychosis. Tainted lucidity does still stave off withdrawal symptoms. Tainted lucidity stings the eyes slightly and lacks the usual greasy feeling.</p>
