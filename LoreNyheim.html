 <p>Here is some of the info on Nyheim durin it's downfall phase around 2030s</p>
 

 <h2 class="font-barrack font-weight-bold color-purple">the mist</h2>
 <p>As the mist reached the Scandinavian region rumors began to circulate of a group focused on combating the mist taking up residence in an abandoned city Nyheim. Most would have heard that Nyheim was a sanctuary city built during the height of the outbreak. As the word’s governments dissolved, a coalition was formed to quickly build a walled city at a remote location with hopes of weathering the outbreak while a cure is developed. Project was funded by what remained of most European nations and executed by the newly formed rapid civil engineering arm of NATO. Details of how have, most likely, been lost to history. Most survivors would know that the project failed either due to being unable to contain infection within its walls. Others would state that Nyheim was never fully finished as bureaucratic infighting amongst participants eventually led to its demise. Regardless of what truly happened, city of Nyheim sat abandoned since mid 2030s</p>

<p>By 2053 Nyheim began to experience a population surge as rumors of a way to fight the mist started to circulate. Many went to Nyheim to see if those rumors were true. Others went to follow those who were curious. Some followed the rest with more nefarious intentions. This started to have a gold rush effect on the local area and population centers all throughout what was once called Norway. As there were no centralized global communications, individual’s knowledge of what Nyheim was or is will vary but many would see it was a way to escape their own current existence</p>
